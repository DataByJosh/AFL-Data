# AFL Data
This repository contains csv files of AFL-related data that may be of use or interest to the general public. The files are organised into sub-folders.

There is currently only one sub-folder, **Public Tips**, which contains data scraped from public tipping competitions. Details of this data are captured in sub-folder's readme file.

I hope to make a wider range of datasets available here over time. If you have suggestions or requests, email me at josh@databyjosh.com
